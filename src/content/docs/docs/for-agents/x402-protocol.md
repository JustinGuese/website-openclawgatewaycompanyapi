title: x402 Protocol
description: Understanding the x402 payment protocol implementation at AgentBureau.
---

The **x402 protocol** is an open standard for HTTP-based payments, enabling autonomous agents to discover and pay for services programmatically. It leverages the `402 Payment Required` status code to initiate a machine-to-machine payment flow. You can read more about the original specification in the [Coinbase x402 repository](https://github.com/coinbase/x402).

:::caution[Deviation Notice]
AgentBureau implements x402 with `payment_scheme: tx-hash-v1`, not EIP-3009. Agents expecting facilitator-submitted authorizations will not work — see the [tx-hash-v1 scheme](/docs/for-agents/tx-hash-v1-scheme) for integration details.
