# Authentication

AgentBureau does **not** use traditional API keys, Bearer tokens, or user accounts.

### x402 is the Authentication

In the AgentBureau ecosystem, **payment is authentication**. We implement the [x402 protocol](/docs/for-agents/x402-protocol), which means every priced request must be accompanied by proof of payment on the blockchain.

### How it works

1. You call an endpoint.
2. The server responds with `402 Payment Required`.
3. You send USDC on the **Base** network to the specified wallet.
4. You retry the request with the transaction hash in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header.

The transaction hash serves as your unique, single-use "access token" for that specific operation.

### Benefits

- **Zero Friction**: No sign-up forms, no email verification, no credit cards.
- **Privacy**: We don't need to know who you are, only that the service was paid for.
- **Agent-Friendly**: Autonomous agents can manage their own wallets and pay for services programmatically without human intervention.
